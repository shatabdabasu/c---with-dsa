// Problem Setup
// You’re given a maze represented as a 2D grid, where:
// 1 represents open cells (can be part of the path),
// 0 represents blocked cells (cannot be part of the path).
// You start at the top-left corner (0,0) and want to reach the bottom-right corner.
// Moves are allowed in four directions: right, down, left, and up.
