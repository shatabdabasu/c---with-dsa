📜 C++ Practice Assignment – Control Structures & Loops


Basic Loops and Number Series
Q1. Write a program to print all odd numbers from 1 to 100.

Q2. Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3.

Q3. Write a program to print the multiplication table of a number n.
(Here, n is taken as input from the user.)

Q4. Display the following Arithmetic Progression (AP) sequence up to n terms:
4, 7, 10, 13, 16…
(Where n is input by the user.)

Q5. Display the following Geometric Progression (GP) sequence up to n terms:
3, 12, 48, 192…
(Where n is input by the user.)

ASCII Values and Character Handling
Q6. Write a program to print all the ASCII values and their equivalent characters for the 26 capital English alphabets using a while loop.

Digit-Based Problems
Q7. Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all even digits of a given number.
(The number is input by the user.)

Q8. Write a program to print the sum of a given number and its reverse.
(The number is input by the user.)

Factorials and Fibonacci
Q9. Write a program to print the factorials of the first n numbers.
(Value of n is input by the user.)

Q10. Write a program to print the first n Fibonacci numbers.
(Value of n is input by the user.)

Special Number Checks
Q11. Write a program to print all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500.
(A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example: 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³)
