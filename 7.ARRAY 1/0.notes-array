Arrays
- Two pointers

- Sliding window

- Prefix / Running sum

- Frequency array

- Hash map

- In-place swap

- Sorting + logic

- Binary search

- Greedy scan

- Brute force (nested loops)

MAP
- key → value storage
- fast lookup using key
- keys are unique
- value can repeat
- insert, find, delete in O(1) average
- unordered_map → faster, no order
- map → ordered (sorted by key)

LIST
- non-contiguous memory
- each node = data + pointer
- dynamic size
- easy insertion/deletion
- slow access (no indexing)
- traversal only sequential
- more memory (pointers)

WHEN TO USE
- map → counting, lookup, frequency
- list → frequent insert/delete in middle

COMMON USE
- map → frequency count, hash table logic
- list → stack, queue, adjacency list
